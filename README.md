## Features

- Seamless integration of Firebase Authentication in a re-frame application.
- Clear demonstration of Firebase setup for user authentication.
- Secure user access and authentication handling within the app.
- Easily adaptable codebase for further expansion and customization.

## Requirements

- [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/guides/quick-start)
- [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame)
- Firebase account and project setup

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up Firebase for your project and retrieve your Firebase configuration.
3. Replace the Firebase configuration placeholders in the code with your own credentials.
4. Run the development server using `lein figwheel` or your preferred ClojureScript build tool.

## Usage

Follow these steps to integrate Firebase Authentication into your re-frame project:

1. Initialize Firebase in your ClojureScript app.
2. Implement Firebase Authentication methods for user sign-in, sign-up, and logout.
3. Utilize re-frame subscriptions and events to manage user authentication state within the app.
4. Customize and expand the authentication flow as per your app's requirements.
